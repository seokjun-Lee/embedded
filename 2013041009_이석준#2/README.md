This project is related to the simple IoT system.

It worked with Python on three Raspberry Pi 3, and the sensors used include buttons, LEDs, and ultrasonic sensors.

For the first time, measure the distance using ultrasonic sensors.
If you approach it within 20 cm, the game will start, and if you are over 20 cm, you will measure the distance again.

Measure it up to five times, and if it does not come within 20 cm, the program is terminated.

If you come within 20 cm, the game begins.

This game is for measuring your reflexes.

At first, all LEDs light up, and if you press the button, the lights go out.

And then, you can see the scores going up at the terminal, and after a random time of up to three seconds, the lights are on again.

You can play the game during the same time as other users, and you can use the score to determine if someone is better at your ability.

Have fun playing games.

Thx.
