This code basically measures temperature and lightness every second.<br/>
It is stored in the database once every 10 seconds using temperature and lightness values.<br/>
When the measured temperature value exceeds 28 degrees for more than 5 seconds, the fan operates.<br/>
When the measured lightness value exceeds 1000, the led turns on.<br/>
Each sensor and module will run as a separate thread.<br/>
Clicking on this link will show you how it works.
